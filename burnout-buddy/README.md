## Burnout Buddy

A serene Next.js + Firebase companion that helps physicians capture 10‑second mood check-ins, run 2‑3 minute micro-resets, and visualize weekly trends—all while keeping data private (demo mode via `localStorage`, authenticated mode via Firestore).

### Stack
- Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind v4 preview
- React Hook Form + Zod for mood selections
- Firebase Auth (Google) & Firestore persistence
- Chart.js for streak + activity insights
- OpenAI Responses API for AI-powered storytelling

### Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` for the landing experience and click **Try Demo** to explore without signing in.

### Environment variables

Create a `.env.local` with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=...
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

- The `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are optional—without them the app defaults to demo mode only.
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` powers the gamified “AI Encouragement” card on the Insights screen. Without it, the UI gracefully notes that AI is unavailable.

### New: Gamification with AI

On the Insights page you’ll now see:
- **Achievement storytelling** – narrative summaries of recent wins.
- **Streak celebration** – congratulatory notes when you keep your streak alive.
- **Progress narratives** – gentle reflections on overall growth.

These stories are generated by calling `/api/gamify`, which wraps the OpenAI Responses API and converts your anonymized stats into JSON `{ achievementStory, streakCelebration, progressNarrative }`.
